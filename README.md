#Processs and Challenges of Creating the Web Portfolio

##Process:

1. Creating a prototype - creating a site map and outlining the structure and layout of the website. 

2. Dividing website structure - identifying different sections and components that will be included.

3. Asset gathering - acquire images and create different sizes for optimisation. Write captions and descriptions.

4. Coding - selecting appropriate classes and funtions to achieve the desired design and functinality. This project required the use of bootstrap, css variables and CSS/JS libraries. 

5. Validation - adjust and edit code to pass Mark-up and CSS validation. Modify code to adhere to Web Accessibility
Evaluation Tool.


##Challenges:

1. Selecting the right Bootstrap classes - there are several classes that are available to achieve a design and it can be challenging to decide which one will fit the project.

2. Selecting CSS/JS libraries - there are multiple CSS and JS libraries that offer amazing functions and add-ons. It can be tempting to add more functions than you actually need, specially for animation.

3. Responsiveness - it's challening to try to achieve a certain level of customization while still maintaining consistency and responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices. 

4. Accessibility - encountered issues with contrast and image error upon validating through WAVE. Made modifications till evaluation showe 0 errors.
